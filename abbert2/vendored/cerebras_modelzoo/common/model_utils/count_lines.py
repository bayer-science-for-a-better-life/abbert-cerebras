def count_lines(filename_pattern):
    """
    Returns linecount in the given filename or sum over all of
    the filenames matching the pattern.

    Takes a filename pattern and globs the pattern
    to get all matching filenames. In order, this function reads all the
    files in raw format for a fixed buffer size till EOF is reached. It
    then counts the number of ``\n``
    in each buffer and returns the sum. Using ``takewhile`` and ``repeat``
    provides inbuilt speedup compared to writing custom while/for loop to
    handle EOF.

    `Note`: The size of the buffer is currently set to 1024*1024, but this
    is not optimized for all files. Some files can be read in faster by
    modifying the buffer size. This value is suboptimal to memory usage on
    a local dev instance.
