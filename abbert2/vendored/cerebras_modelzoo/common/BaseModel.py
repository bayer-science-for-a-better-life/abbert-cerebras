    Base model class.
    Provides a general model API, consisting of the
    following methods that must be implemented by child classes:
        `build_model`: builds the model
        `build_total_loss`: builds total loss, given model
            outputs returned by build_model
        `build_train_ops`: sets up an optimizer and returns asscoiated train ops
        `build_eval_metric_ops`: build evaluation metric ops

    The `__call__` function wraps around `build_model`.

    All models must inherit from BaseModel and implement
    `__init__` (containing the call to BaseModel's __init__),
    `build_model`, `build_total_loss`, `build_train_ops`, and
    `build_eval_metric_ops` methods.
