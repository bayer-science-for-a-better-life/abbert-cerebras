def metric_variable(shape, dtype, validate_shape=True, name=None):
    """Create variable in `GraphKeys.(LOCAL|METRIC_VARIABLES)` collections.

    If running in a `DistributionStrategy` context, the variable will be
    "sync on read". This means:

    *   The returned object will be a container with separate variables
            per replica of the model.

    *   When writing to the variable, e.g. using `assign_add` in a metric
            update, the update will be applied to the variable local to the
            replica.

    *   To get a metric's result value, we need to sum the variable values
            across the replicas before computing the final answer. Furthermore,
            the final answer should be computed once instead of in every
            replica. Both of these are accomplished by running the computation
            of the final result value inside
            `distribution_strategy_context.get_replica_context().merge_call(fn)`.
            Inside the `merge_call()`, ops are only added to the graph once
            and access to a sync on read variable in a computation returns
            the sum across all replicas.

    Returns:
        A (non-trainable) variable initialized to zero, or if inside a
        `DistributionStrategy` scope a sync on read variable container.
